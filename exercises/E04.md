# In class:
- Run the "package" SBT command to create a JAR
- What is the name of the generated JAR? How can you change it?
  Use the `inspect` commands to figure that out.

Homework Assignment
===================

Homework is due on Nov 20, 23:59 via email to <pgiarrusso@informatik.uni-marburg.de>.
Please choose the subject title "SLE05".
In case you only have partial solutions, please submit them anyway.

# Discussion exercise
- Describe briefly the different DSLs we have seen in the lecture on SBT
(command-line DSL, configuration DSL, file search (micro-)DSL, command execution (micro-)DSL). One or two sentences for each are appropriate.

As a reminder of those DSL, see [the code from the lecture](https://github.com/klauso/SLE2013/blob/master/lectures/08-sbt-sample/project/Build.scala), including comments and links.

What kind of entities does one manipulate with each of those DSLs, if any?
Should they be considered DSLs, in your opinion?

# Using SBT
Choose whether to do the basic exercises or the advanced ones.
- Basic exercises will bring you to a basic understanding of SBT. This
  understanding will be directly useful since we will use SBT for other exercises.

- Advanced exercises encourage you to experiment with advanced uses of SBT.

If you're familiar with SBT, you might find the advanced
exercises more interesting.

Our general reference for SBT is the
[official documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.0/docs/index.html).

## Basic exercise 1

Suppose we are working on a client-server project in Scala, where different clients and servers share a common communication protocol.

We want to implement a library providing support for this protocol and reuse it across different projects. For now we simply have a stub for this library.

Hence, your goal is to set up a project for this library, a project for the client, and allow the client to reuse a compiled version of the library.

One way to achieve this is to create a library project (with some example code), a client project (with code using the library), choose a suitable name for the first project, publish the first locally (with the `publish-to` command) and add the library as a [managed dependency](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Library-Dependencies.html#managed-dependencies) to the second project.
For comparison, try adding to the client project another dependency, like
[ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/download).

Alternatively, you can also try setting up
[multiple related projects](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Multi-Project.html):
this supports better developing library and client together (which might or
might not be your scenario), but takes a bit more knowledge to set up.

## Basic exercise 2

Familiarize yourself with some basic build settings.

1. Try enabling some options for Scalac to detect more issues with the code.
I often use these:
"-unchecked", "-deprecation", "-feature",
"-language:implicitConversions", "-language:higherKinds", "-Ywarn-adapted-args",
"-Ywarn-inaccessible", "-Ywarn-nullary-override", "-Ywarn-nullary-unit",
"-Ywarn-numeric-widen"

2. The current SBT release uses by default Scala 2.10.2. How can you override
   this default, to use for instance 2.10.3?

3. Can you translate the build definition from .sbt to a full definition, or viceversa?

## Advanced exercises:

- SBT DSLs are available inside Scala; therefore, you can reuse the full Scala language inside your DSL programs.
  Can you show an example where you use this capability to your advantage?
  The command-line DSL is not available inside Scala. Is that a problem?

- Have you experienced a scenario where build or deployment automation was
  important and where SBT might have been (or was) useful?
  Could you sketch how to implement such automation with SBT?

- SBT is extensible by plugins. Describe a use-case for some
  [existing SBT plugin](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Community/Community-Plugins.html), and provide an example project sketching the usage.

  Among those plugins, you might want to take a look at `sbt-man`,
  `sbt-scalariform`, or at some of the release plugins, or Android plugins if
  you do Android development.
