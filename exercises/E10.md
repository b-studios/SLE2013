Using the LMS-like interface we have seen in the lecture, try to perform the following tasks. If you have problems, please send in partial or non-compiling solutions with a description of the point where you are stuck.

- Try defining an interface for lists, providing methods for map and flatMap.
- after completing this task, try implementing map fusion in this framework via pattern matching on reified expressions.
- Try extending the language of integers and defining an evaluator for reified arithmetic expressions in this language. For simplicity, you don't need to deal with functions or variables.

Now, compare this evaluator with the evaluation semantics for polymorphic embeddings defined in previous lectures: were the evaluation semantics recursive? Was the recursion somewhere else? Is this evaluator recursive, or is the recursion somewhere? Compare and contrast the different schemes.

For bonus points:
- Try extending the evaluator to handle functions, and compare with the one for HOAS functions in polymorphic embedding.
